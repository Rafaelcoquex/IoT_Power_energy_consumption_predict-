# IoT_Power_energy_consumption_predict-

Project carried out as part of the Data Scientist Formation offered by the institution [Data Science Academy](https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br).

This IoT project aims to create predictive models for predicting energy consumption of household appliances. 
The data used include measurements of temperature and humidity sensors of a wireless network, weather forecast of an airport station and energy use by luminaries.

The data set was collected for a period of 10 minutes for about 5 months. The house temperature and humidity conditions were monitored with a ZigBee wireless sensor network.

Each wireless knot transmitted the temperature and humidity conditions in about 3 min. Then, the average of the data was calculated for periods of 10 minutes.

The energy data were recorded every 10 minutes with m bus energy meters. The weather from the nearest weather station (Chievres Airport, Belgium) was downloaded from a public Reliable Prognosis (rp5.ru) data set and merged with the experimental data sets using the date and time column.
